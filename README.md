# Chess - Simulator for Windows, Linux, Mac and Android

 Chess simulator made with Unity Engine.

Through this application you can play games against the machine or against another player (locally or through the Internet).

The game is in the development phase, so a bug may appear from time to time. Feel free to contact me if you find a problem that needs to be fixed.

I hope you enjoy it!
